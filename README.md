# Troubled-Lender-Classification

For most financial institutions, such as banks and multi-finance companies, their main source of income is coming from their lending activities. By engaging in this activity, it means that lenders are exposed to the potential risk, where debtors stop repaying their loans, causing losses to the lenders. To mitigate this loss, lenders are expected to appropriately choose who are qualified for a loan, at what rate, and at what amount.  

In this question, Our task is to help the troubled lenders with this problem by creating a model that can help them make their decision. The lenders also provided the following dataset that we can use.

## Given the dataset above, the model was created to rank the loan applicants based on their repayment capability. The rank will then be used to choose who are eligible for a loan, lower interest rate and higher credit limit.
